%h1 Introduction

This site is dedicated to industry professionals and others interested in the planning history of Jersey land and property. Registered members obtain unrestricted access to our database and services (see below)

%h1 Services available
%ul
  %li Our database contains all planning applications published by the Jersey Planning Department and is fully searchable in a simple tabular format. Searches may include fields not searchable via the <a href='https://www.mygov.je/planning/pages/planning.aspx', target='_blank'>Planning register</a>, such as:
  %ul
    %li application description
    %li applicant (name/addess)
    %li agent
    %li policy constraints - e.g. 'Green Zone'
  %li We also provide the ability to retrieve planning history* for one or more area(s) of interest by outlining area(s) on a map. This offers a very efficient way to access the planning history of a large or complex site, as searchig by address, for example, may not always yield all results expected
  %li Applications are linked to all Planning Application Panel and Ministerial Meetings at which they were/will be discussed. This facilitates very quick access to the detail of contested cases, particularly applications which have been the subject of several Panel or Minsterial meetings

%p * All applications since 2001
%p ** Meetings since 2014 currently
