  %li Our database contains all planning applications published by the Jersey Planning Department and is fully searchable in a simple tabular format. Searches may include Applicant, Agent, policy Constraint and other fields not searchable via the <a href='https://www.mygov.je/planning/pages/planning.aspx', target='_blank'>Planning register</a>
  %li We also provide the ability to retrieve planning history* for one or more area(s) of interest by outlining area(s) on a map. This offers a very efficient way to access the planning history of a large or complex site, as searchig by address, for example, may not always yield all results expected
  %li Applications are linked to all Planning Application Panel and Ministerial Meetings at which they were/will be discussed. This facilitates very quick access to the detail of contested cases, particularly applications which have been the subject of several Panel or Minsterial meetings

%p * All applications since 2001
%p ** Meetings since 2014 currently
